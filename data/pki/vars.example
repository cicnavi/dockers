# Easy-RSA 3 parameter settings

# NOTE: If you installed Easy-RSA from your package manager, do not edit
# this file in place -- instead, you should copy the entire easy-rsa directory
# to another location so future upgrades do not wipe out your changes.

# HOW TO USE THIS FILE
#
# vars.example contains built-in examples to Easy-RSA settings. You MUST name
# this file "vars" if you want it to be used as a configuration file. If you
# do not, it WILL NOT be automatically read when you call easyrsa commands.
#
# It is not necessary to use this config file unless you wish to change
# operational defaults. These defaults should be fine for many uses without
# the need to copy and edit the "vars" file.
#
# All of the editable settings are shown commented and start with the command
# "set_var" -- this means any set_var command that is uncommented has been
# modified by the user. If you are happy with a default, there is no need to
# define the value to its default.

# NOTES FOR WINDOWS USERS
#
# Paths for Windows  *MUST* use forward slashes, or optionally double-escaped
# backslashes (single forward slashes are recommended.) This means your path
# to the openssl binary might look like this:
# "C:/Program Files/OpenSSL-Win32/bin/openssl.exe"

# A little housekeeping: DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION
#
# Easy-RSA 3.x does not source into the environment directly.
# Complain if a user tries to do this:
if [ -z "$EASYRSA_CALLER" ]; then
	echo "You appear to be sourcing an Easy-RSA *vars* file. This is" >&2
	echo "no longer necessary and is disallowed. See the section called" >&2
	echo "*How to use this file* near the top comments for more details." >&2
	return 1

# DO YOUR EDITS BELOW THIS POINT

# If your OpenSSL command is not in the system PATH, you will need to define
# the path here. Normally this means a full path to the executable, otherwise
# you could have left it undefined here and the shown default would be used.
#
# Windows users, remember to use paths with forward-slashes (or escaped
# back-slashes.) Windows users should declare the full path to the openssl
# binary here if it is not in their system PATH.
#
#set_var EASYRSA_OPENSSL	"openssl"
#
# This sample is in Windows syntax -- edit it for your path if not using PATH:
#set_var EASYRSA_OPENSSL	"C:/Program Files/OpenSSL-Win32/bin/openssl.exe"

# Windows users, to generate OpenVPN TLS Keys the Openvpn binary must be
# defined here.
#
#set_var EASYRSA_OPENVPN "C:\\Program Files\\Openvpn\\bin\\openvpn.exe"

# Define X509 DN mode.
#
# This is used to adjust which elements are included in the Subject field
# as the DN ("Distinguished Name"). Note that in 'cn_only' mode the
# Organizational fields, listed further below, are not used.
#
# Choices are:
#   cn_only  - Use just a commonName value.
#   org      - Use the "traditional" format:
#              Country/Province/City/Org/Org.Unit/email/commonName
#
#set_var EASYRSA_DN	"cn_only"

# Organizational fields (used with "org" mode and ignored in "cn_only" mode).
# These are the default values for fields which will be placed in the
# certificate.  Do not leave any of these fields blank, although interactively
# you may omit any specific field by typing the "." symbol (not valid for
# email).
#
# NOTE: The following characters are not supported
#       in these "Organizational fields" by Easy-RSA:
#       back-tick (`)

#set_var EASYRSA_REQ_COUNTRY	"US"
#set_var EASYRSA_REQ_PROVINCE	"California"
#set_var EASYRSA_REQ_CITY	"San Francisco"

# Preserve the Distinguished Name field order

# Set no password mode - This will create the entire PKI without passwords.
# This can be better managed by choosing which entity private keys should be
# encrypted with the following command line options:
# Global option '--no-pass' or command option 'nopass'.
#
#set_var EASYRSA_NO_PASS	1

# Choose a size in bits for your keypairs. The recommended value is 2048.
# Using 2048-bit keys is considered more than sufficient for many years into
# the future. Larger keysizes will slow down TLS negotiation and make key/DH
# param generation take much longer. Values up to 4096 should be accepted by
# most software. Only used when the crypto alg is rsa, see below.
#
#set_var EASYRSA_KEY_SIZE	2048

# The default crypto mode is rsa; ec can enable elliptic curve support.
# Note that not all software supports ECC, so use care when enabling it.
# Choices for crypto alg are: (each in lower-case)
#  * rsa
#  * ec
#  * ed
#
#set_var EASYRSA_ALGO		rsa

# Define the named curve, used in ec & ed modes:

#
#set_var EASYRSA_CA_EXPIRE	3650

# In how many days should certificates expire?
#
#set_var EASYRSA_CERT_EXPIRE	825

# How many days until the Certificate Revokation List will expire.
#
# IMPORTANT: When the CRL expires, an OpenVPN Server which uses a
# CRL will reject ALL new connections, until the CRL is replaced.
